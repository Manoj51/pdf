Two major libraries for complex text layout are HarfBuzz and pango. They are text shaping engines. 
Arabic and Devanagari scripts have very difficult text layout. Hence they need to be handled correclty. 

HarfBuzz is a software development library for text shaping, which is the process of 
converting Unicode text to glyph indices and positions.
